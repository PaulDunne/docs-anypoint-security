Anypoint Security is a suite of features designed to protect your deployed applications using TLS/SNI validation for your endpoints, management and secure storage of your secrets such as username/password or keystores, and policies to detect and prevent external threads.

Anypoint Security uses Edge, a high-performance, reliable, and scalable service to enforce policies for DDoS (distributed denial of service), CAP (content attack prevention), and TLS/SNI Termination.
== What Can Anypoint Security Do?

=== Policies

Anypoint Security features a high-performance, reliable, and scalable service to enforce policies that apply to all nodes deployed to your Runtime Fabric. +
You can protect your APIs using three policies:

* DoS (Denial of service) policy. +
These policies are designed to protect your nodes against malicious clients trying to flood your network to prevent legitimate traffic to your APIs. +
Learn more about the xref:dos-policy.adoc[DoS Policy].
* ACL (Access Control List) Policy. +
This policy lets you whitelist specific range of IP addresses to reach your APIs. +
Learn more about the xref:acl-policy.adoc[ACL Policy].
* CAP (Content Attack Prevenetion) policy. +
This policy prevents attacks from clients that send large messages that can take up all of your processing bandwidth. +
Learn more about the xref:cap-policy.adoc[CAP Policy].

You can use these policies to handle all traffic to your Runtime Fabric, and leverage API Manager policies for handling specific behaviors to specific APIs.

Anypoint Security policies then act as a default firewall/router capability through which all traffic traverses. +
It provides:

* Firewall Threat Prevention.
** Content Attack Prevention (Traffic shaping).
** Denial of Service.
** IP Whitelists.
* Advanced TLS  (e.g. Cert-pinning, CRL).
* Basic TLS  (e.g. Mutual TLS, SSL Termination).
* Secrets/Certificate Management.

Additionally, the API policies in front of your applications act as standard set of security policies, and give your the ability to further customize or extend certain limitations you are applying at the general security level. +
This layer of security provides the same control as any API Manager policy offers. For example:

* Basic TLS (e.g. Mutual TLS, SSL Termination)
* OWASP CRS Web Application Firewall (WAF)
* Rate Limiting
* OAuth & AAA

To apply policies, you need to have the *Manage Runtime Fabrics* permission associated to your user. +
An administrator for your organization can grant you this permission Access Management.

Additionally, your account must have associated the *Runtime Fabrics* and *Security Edge Policies* entitlements.
