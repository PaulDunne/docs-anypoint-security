= Policies

Anypoint Security features a high-performance, reliable, and scalable service to enforce policies that apply to all nodes deployed to your Runtime Fabric. +

You can protect your APIs using three policies:

* DoS (Denial of service) policy. +
These policies are designed to protect your nodes against malicious clients trying to flood your network to prevent legitimate traffic to your APIs. +
Learn more about the xref:dos-policy.adoc[DoS Policy].
* ACL (Access Control List) Policy. +
This policy checks HTTP proctocol message size and headers. +
Learn more about the xref:acl-policy.adoc[ACL Policy].
* CAP (Content Attack Prevention) policy. +
This policy prevents attacks from clients that send large messages that can take up all of your processing bandwidth. +
Learn more about the xref:cap-policy.adoc[CAP Policy].

You can use these policies to handle all traffic to your Runtime Fabric, and leverage API Manager policies for handling specific behaviors to specific APIs.

Anypoint Security policies then act as a default router capability through which all traffic traverses. +
It provides:

* Threat Prevention.
** Content Attack Prevention (header and message limits checks).
** Denial of Service.
** IP Whitelists.
* Advanced TLS  (e.g. Cert-pinning, CRL).
* Basic TLS  (e.g. Mutual TLS, SSL Termination).

Additionally, API policies configured in API Manager and running in API gateway give your the ability to further customize or extend certain limitations you are applying at the mule application level. +
This layer of security provides the same control as any API Manager policy offers. For example:

* Basic TLS (e.g. Mutual TLS, SSL Termination)
* Rate Limiting
* OAuth & AAA

Additionally, your account must have associated the *Runtime Fabrics* and *Security Edge Policies* entitlements in addition to API Manager & Analytics.

To apply policies, you need to have the *Manage Runtime Fabrics* permission associated to your user. +
An administrator for your organization can grant you this permission Access Management.
