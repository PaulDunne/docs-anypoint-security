= Enable DoS for a WAF Policy

You can, optionally, edit a DoS policy to escalate a WAF policy to DoS.

There are a couple of reasons why you may want DoS thresholding even though individual WAF errors are already rejected with a status code of 400.

* Without DoS thresholding applied, parsing request bodies can be expensive in terms of CPU. If you continue to get a high rate of these requests, it will consume a lot of resources just to detect the errors.
If DoS thresholding is implemented, when the threshold for DoS is exceeded, it will cease to parse request bodies. +
When a blocked IP address attempts to connect, the request will be rejected based solely on the IP address. This is extremely efficient. If “Drop Silently” is enabled for DoS, resources will not even be wasted to complete the TLS connection.
* Malicious source IP addresses may be attempting many other requests other than those triggering WAF. Some of these requests may look valid. When the DoS threshold is exceeded, all requests, good or bad, will be dropped for the identified IP address.



== Escalate a WAF Policy to DoS

To escalate a WAF policy to DoS, you must first have a DoS policy defined. See xref:dos-policy.adoc[] for information about configuring a DoS policy.

. In *Security Policies*, click *Edit* for the DoS policy for which to configure WAF errors.
. In the left menu, click *WAF Errors*.
. Configure the WAF errors, and click *Save*. +
All WAF errors are thresholded in this error bucket.

In the example shown in the image, for *Window 1*, all requests for the Source IP address are blocked if more than 10 WAF errors are received within a 60-second time interval. (The default is 60 seconds, but this value can be changed in the *General* tab for the DoS policy.)

In *Window 2*, the settings mean that if this WAF error occurs three times in a period of 5 *Window 1* intervals (5 60-second intervals in this case), the IP address is blocked forever.
