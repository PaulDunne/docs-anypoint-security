= Web Application Security Policy

The Web Application Firewall (WAF) security policy is available for Runtime Fabric Ingress to provide protection at the Web application level. WAF policies provide the xref:https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_ModSecurity_Core_Rule_Set_Project[OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS)] functionality checking for requests and responses, which provides an industry standard security baseline. This checking provides a set of detection rules for common web application attacks.

[NOTE]
Only the official OWASP CRS rules are supported.

WAF policies are fully integrated with the existing Anypoint Security policy DoS (Denial of Service). When the WAF policy detects errors, it thresholds the errors to the DoS, which can be optionally configured to take actions such as shaping or blocking traffic for a potentially malicious source IP address.
